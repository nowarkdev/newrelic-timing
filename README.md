NewRelic Timing
===============

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/uken/newrelic-timing.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/uken/newrelic-timing)

Integrates Single Page Apps with NewRelic's Real User Monitoring

### Installing

Make sure you have bower. Also see http://bower.io/

    npm install -g bower

then run:

    bower install newrelic-timing

For Rails, consider using [bower-rails gem](https://github.com/42dev/bower-rails) or https://rails-assets.org/ and add the following to your Gemfile:

```ruby
source 'https://rails-assets.org'

gem "rails-assets-newrelic-timing"
```

### AngularJS 

To install add both `newrelic-timing.js` and `newrelic-timing-angular.js` scripts to your html, then add `newrelic-timing` to your angular module dependencies.

```javascript
angular.module('your.application', [
  // other dependencies
  'newrelic-timing'
]);
```

Supports both ui-router and ngRoute. 

### Configuration

There are no configuration options in newrelic-timling. You only need to make sure that the New Relic javascript is loaded correctly (through injection or by copy-pasting the snippet). Steps explaining how to add the New Relic javascript to your website can be found on their [website](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/browser/new-relic-browser/installation-configuration/adding-apps-new-relic-browser).

Once configured correctly, newrelic-timing will use the API exposed by New Relic to send timing information to the New Relic server. These timings will show up as APM Transactions in the New Relic Browser dashboards.


### Usage

- `newrelic-timing.js` exposes `window.newrelicTiming` that does all the work.
- `newrelic-timing-angular.js` hooks `newrelicTiming` into angular router state changes.

Please take a look at `newrelic-timing-angular.js` as an example of how to integrate this into your framework.
